# Rule Based Customer Segmentation
Gezinomi has been a platform providing services in the tourism and hospitality sector in Turkey since 2015. In this project, Gezinomi aims to create level-based new sales definitions using some features of its sales. The goal is to generate segments based on these new sales definitions and predict how much new customers, based on these segments, could potentially contribute to the company on average. The dataset used in this project contains information about the prices of sales made by Gezinomi. The dataset consists of records generated for each sales transaction. This implies that the table has not been singularized. In other words, a customer may have made multiple purchases.
